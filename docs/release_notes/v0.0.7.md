# Bundle GitHub action updates that pin to commit SHA

This version adds the ability to detect if an action is pinning to a SHA rather than a version like this:

```yaml
      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@98669ae865ea3cffbcbaa878cf57c20bbf1c6c38
        with:
          images: weaveworks/eksctl
```

In this case, dependabot will open a PR against a new Tag but will use the commit sha of that tag.

Now, bundler will also do that and will create a diff like this:

```diff
      - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
        id: meta
-       uses: docker/metadata-action@98669ae865ea3cffbcbaa878cf57c20bbf1c6c38
+       uses: docker/metadata-action@69f6fc9d46f2f8bf0d5491e4aabe0bb8c6a4678a
        with:
          images: weaveworks/eksctl
```
